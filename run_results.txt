Threats:
  - Gholdengo (pressure 0.83) :: Coverage hits 5 member(s): Amoonguss, Armarouge, Dragonite, Granbull, Hatterene
  - Incineroar (pressure 0.64) :: Threatens 2 teammate(s): Armarouge, Hatterene, Historical win rate ≈ 64%

  - Armarouge (pressure 0.6) :: Threatens 1 teammate(s): Amoonguss, Historical win rate ≈ 60%
  - Landorus-Therian (pressure 0.59) :: Threatens 2 teammate(s): Armarouge, Dragonite, Historical win rate ≈ 59%
Coverage gaps:

  - No reliable resist for Poison attacks detected.
  - No reliable resist for Flying attacks detected.
  - No reliable resist for Rock attacks detected.
  - No reliable resist for Ghost attacks detected.
  - No reliable resist for Dragon attacks detected.
  - No reliable resist for Dark attacks detected.
Recommendations:
  - Prep answers for Incineroar which pressures multiple teammates.
  - Team lacks a defined primary attacker; consider adding a sweeper.
  - Team cannot hit normal, fire, water types super-effectively. Consider adding coverage moves.
  - Only one team member covers ice, ground types. If that Pokemon faints, you lose that coverage.
Per-Pokémon insights:
  - Hatterene: Primary attacker; strengths: Seen in 2.0% of gen9vgc2025regh teams, This set provdes Fairy coverage; risks: No ground coverage (common in VGC for hitting Steels/Electrics)
  - Amoonguss: Speed control; strengths: Seen in 14.0% of gen9vgc2025regh teams, This set provdes Dark, Poison coverage, Tera Steel offers matchup flexibility; risks: No major risks
  - Armarouge: Speed control; strengths: Seen in 2.0% of gen9vgc2025regh teams, This set provdes Fire, Psychic coverage; risks: No major risks
  - Tornadus: Utility support; strengths: This set provdes Flying, Poison coverage; risks: No major risks
  - Dragonite: Speed control; strengths: Seen in 36.0% of gen9vgc2025regh teams, This set provdes Dragon, Ice, Normal coverage, Tera Normal offers matchup flexibility; risks: No major risks
  - Granbull: Primary attacker; strengths: This set provdes Dark, Fairy, Psychic coverage; risks: No ground coverage (common in VGC for hitting Steels/Electrics)
Meta scouting:
  - None: Metagross (steel, psychic) - Resists dragon, fairy, flying, grass, ice, normal, psychic, rock, steel; Weak to dark, fire, ghost, ground; Immune to poison
Gemini Summary:
This team employs good speed control but is highly vulnerable to **Ice-type attacks**. **Gholdengo** poses the most immediate threat, impacting five team members, while **Incineroar** applies significant pressure, particularly to Armarouge and Hatterene.
Offensively, the team struggles to super-effectively hit **Normal, Fire, and Water** types and lacks consistent **Ground** coverage, exposing Hatterene and Granbull. Despite these Pokémon being designated primary attackers, the overall offensive identity is somewhat undefined, suggesting a need for a more dominant sweeper.
Key adjustments include **preparing robust answers for Incineroar**, bolstering offensive coverage for Normal/Fire/Water types, and securing more reliable defensive checks against Ice and Ground threats to prevent single points of failure.

Gemini Summary:
This team is heavily centered on **speed control**, with all six Pokémon identified in that role. However, this creates significant vulnerabilities:
**Key Threats:**
*   **Chi-Yu (Top Threat):** Pressures Torkoal and boasts a high historical win rate.
*   **Gholdengo & Kingambit:** Pose significant threats, hitting multiple team members (Gholdengo) or Polteageist hard (Kingambit).
*   **Landorus-Therian & Amoonguss:** Also present challenges, particularly for Torkoal (Lando-T) and Grimmsnarl/Hawlucha (Amoonguss).
**Coverage Gaps & Weaknesses:**
*   **Top Weakness: Fairy.** The team lacks dedicated Fairy resists or immunities, making it highly susceptible to this common offensive type.
*   **Missing Offensive Coverage:** Critically, the team **cannot hit Flying or Fairy types super-effectively**. This is a major defensive and offensive flaw.
*   **Fragile Coverage:** Only one team member covers Normal and Electric types, creating a single point of failure.
**Strategic Gaps & Adjustments:**
*   **Lack of Primary Attacker:** Despite its speed control focus, the team **lacks a defined primary sweeper or offensive threat**. This makes closing games difficult.
*   **Adjustments:**
    *   **Add a Fairy resist/immunity** to mitigate the top weakness.
    *   **Incorporate answers for Chi-Yu**.
    *   **Introduce a dedicated primary attacker** to capitalize on speed control.
    *   **Diversify offensive coverage** to hit Flying, Fairy, and bolster Normal/Electric.
