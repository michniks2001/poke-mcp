# VGC Analysis Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the 10 critical pillars needed for accurate VGC analysis.

## Priority Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical)
1. **Speed Tier Engine** - Required for all battle analysis
2. **Damage Calculation Module** - Needed for accurate threat assessment
3. **Enhanced Role Inference** - Builds on existing, improves accuracy

### Phase 2: Core Analysis (High Priority)
4. **Battle-Aware Coverage Engine** - Replaces flat type counting
5. **Meta Threat Library** - Real VGC sets with damage benchmarks
6. **Threat Modeling** - Uses actual calcs, not win rates

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)
7. **Synergy Scoring Engine** - Defensive/offensive synergy
8. **Archetype Classification** - Proper rule sets
9. **Recommendation Logic** - Trade-offs and slot analysis

### Phase 4: Polish (Lower Priority)
10. **Confidence Tracking** - Assumptions and confidence levels
11. **Structured Output** - Clear, consistent format
